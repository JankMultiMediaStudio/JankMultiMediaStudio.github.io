                    <p>If you want to commission something, here are the rules: You come up with a subject and choose a form from bellow, for example: refridgerator and interactive, or a contemplative afternoon after a tragic event and sound, then pay for the work duration fee. Then I'll produce that work, based on your input, in the corresponding time frame. The longer time frame you choose, the more detail, quality, and or duration the resulting commission will have. When its done I'll give you a copy of the work for no additional cost (unless you want something physically produced/shipped). I reserve full rights to reproduce and sell copies of the product, that way I can keep the commission prices low, otherwise we can talk price for the redistribution rights. Also I can't do anything involving anyone else's copyrighted or patented materials.</p>
                    <p>Commissions:</p>
                    <p>Small: Time: One day; Price: $90</p>

                    <p>Large: Time: One month; Price: $2000</p><br>
                    <p>Forms:</p>

                    <p>If you want a commission, reach out to me over email at JankMultiMediaStudio@gmail.com or on any of my social media accounts of the same name. We can work out the specifics, then you'll send the fee over <a href="https://www.paypal.me/JankStudio">paypal</a>.</p><br>
                    <p>If you want something specific, like a particular character or something, we could talk about it, but there won't be a stable price structure.</p>
                    <p>There may be other queued commisions. When you order a commission, your commission will be added to the back of the list.</p>
                    <p>Antisipated commission wait time: 10 day(s)</p>
