            <p>Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm an artist of arguably too many trades. I offer both commissions and products. If you want to check out an individual product, check the links below and find what you want. If you like my art in general, jump into my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/JankStudio">Patreon</a>, there I offer everything that I produce that month for one flat fee which is much cheaper than buying them individually. If you want to commission me to make something here are the rules: You come up with a project in a single sentence and a medium of your choice, then pay the associated fee. Then I'll produce that work for you in the corresponding time frame. When its done I'll give you a copy of the work for no additional cost (unless you want something physically shipped). I'll reserve full rights to reproduce and sell copies of the product, that way I can keep the commission prices low.</p>
            <p>Commissions:</p>
            <p>Small: Time: One day; Price: $17</p>
            <p>Medium: Time: One week; Price: $125</p>
            <p>Large: Time: One month; Price: $500</p><br>
            <p>If you want a commission, reach out to me over email at JankMultiMediaStudio@gmail.com or on any of my social media accounts of the same name. We can work out the specifics, then you'll send the fee over <a href="https://www.paypal.me/JankStudio">paypal</a>.</p><br>
